# Power-BI-Dashboards
**Problem Statement:**
AtliQ Technologies provides computer hardware and peripheral manufacturing services to its clients and has multiple branches across India. The sales director is encountering challenges in understanding the company's performance and identifying current issues, as sales are lower than anticipated and declining gradually. When the sales director contacts the regional managers for updates on sales and market conditions, they seem to be uncomfortable with interpreting data from Excel files, leading to frustration due to this common human behavior.
**Solution:**
The AltiQ hardware's sales director opted to create a PowerBI Dashboard to transform data into visual representations for making data-driven decisions. As a result, he enlisted a team of data professionals to accomplish this objective.
